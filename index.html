    <p>Hi! Weâ€™re <strong>Eric, Cara, and our daughter Blake</strong>. Weâ€™re a normal (well... mostly normal) family who has completely fallen in love with the neighborhoods in Shaker Heights.</p>
    <p>Weâ€™re those people who slow-roll past open houses and whisper <em>"maybe this is the one"</em>. Blake has already picked out which sidewalk she wants to chalk onâ€¦ we just need a house attached.</p>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <div class="about-wrapper">
      <img src="family.jpg" alt="Our family photo" class="about-photo">
      <div>
        <p>Eric works in cloud technology (yes, the internet kind), and Cara works in finance for a private equity firm in Cleveland. Weâ€™re professionals, devoted parents, and the kind of people who return your trash cans from the curb and bring cookies to new neighbors.</p>
        <p>Weâ€™ve been dreaming of living in this community for yearsâ€”and weâ€™re finally ready to put down roots. Weâ€™re serious buyers, fully pre-approved, and flexible on timing. If youâ€™ve even <em>thought</em> about selling, weâ€™d love to talkâ€”no pressure, just a conversation.</p>

    <h2>Why This Area?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tree-lined streets full of charm</li>
      <li>Work is just minutes away</li>
      <li>Parks, trails, and so many families</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also, weâ€™ve already memorized every house on the MLS... and none of them are <em>quite</em> right. Yours might be.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="map">
    <h2>Where We're Looking</h2>
    <p>Weâ€™re especially interested in homes around Claythorne, Ashley, Parnell, South Woodland, and nearby streets. If your house is hereâ€”or you know a neighbor whoâ€™s ready for a changeâ€”weâ€™d love to hear from you!</p>

    <h2>Why Sell to Us?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We're a small family with big love for this neighborhood</li>
      <li>Weâ€™re pre-approved and flexible on timing (you pick when!)</li>
      <li>We arenâ€™t flippers or investorsâ€”we want to raise our daughter here</li>
      <li>Weâ€™ll treat your home with the care and pride it deserves</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're even <em>thinking</em> about moving, letâ€™s chatâ€”no agents, no pressure, just people who love your house as much as you do.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="letter">
    <h2>Dear Future Neighbor,</h2>
    <p>We know itâ€™s unusual to find a website like thisâ€”but thatâ€™s how much we love your neighborhood. We spend so much time here it already feels like home. Weâ€™re just missing the house.</p>
    <p>If youâ€™re planning to move, downsizing, or just curious about your homeâ€™s valueâ€”weâ€™d be honored to talk. We promise to be kind, respectful, and genuinely grateful for your time.</p>
    <p>Warmly,<br>Eric, Cara & Blake Spaulding</p>

  <section class="section" id="referral">
    <h2>Know a Neighbor Whoâ€™s Moving?</h2>
    <p>Sometimes the best homes never hit the market. If you know someone on your block who's even <em>thinking</em> of sellingâ€”send them our way. You might help two families at once.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="contact">
    <h2>Letâ€™s Talk</h2>
    <p>If you're thinking about sellingâ€”or just want to feel flattered that someone really loves your houseâ€”text or call Eric:</p>
    <p><strong>ðŸ“± 216-435-1340</strong></p>
    <p>You can also email us at <strong>eric@spaulding.family</strong></p>
    <p>Weâ€™ll keep everything private and low-pressure. Weâ€™re just a family trying to find our forever spot in a place we love.</p>

    <p>Thanks for considering us. We promise to be the neighbors who shovel your walk when youâ€™re out of town.</p>
