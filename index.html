    <section class="intro">
      <p>Hi! We’re <strong>Eric, Cara, and our daughter Blake</strong>. We’re a normal (well... mostly normal) family who has completely fallen in love with the neighborhoods in Shaker Heights.</p>
      <p>We spend weekends driving through this neighborhood with the windows down, pointing out our favorite houses and dreaming out loud. Blake already knows which trees are the best for leaf piles—we just need a place to call home underneath them.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="about">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <div class="about-wrapper">
        <img src="family-heart.png" alt="Our family photo" class="about-photo">
        <div>
          <p>Eric works locally as a cloud architect (the internet kind), and Cara works in finance for a private equity firm in Cleveland. We’re professionals, devoted parents, and the kind of people who return your trash cans from the curb and bring cookies to new neighbors. We love coffee shop mornings, lazy sidewalk strolls, and waving at every dog that walks by.</p>

          <p>Blake is our spunky, sidewalk-chalking 3-year-old who is already obsessed with bikes, bugs, and books. She’s thriving in this area and we want her to grow up in a neighborhood full of warmth and community. Our dream is to raise her surrounded by great neighbors, good schools, and quiet streets where childhood memories can be made.</p>
          
          <p>We’ve been dreaming of living in this community for years—and we’re finally ready to put down roots. We’re serious buyers, fully pre-approved, and flexible on timing. We’re not here to make a quick flip—we’re here to make a forever home. If you’ve even <em>thought</em> about selling, we’d love to talk—no pressure, just a conversation.</p>
                  </div>

    <section class="section" id="why">
      <h2>Why This Area?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Gorgeous tree-lined streets</li>
        <li>Peaceful sidewalks, welcoming neighbors, and front yards that actually get used</li>
        <li>Close to our work, our schools, and our favorite weekend activities</li>
        <li>Parks, playgrounds, and trails where kids grow up outside—not just online</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’ve been quietly admiring homes here for years—and yes, we’ve stalked the MLS. But the ones listed publicly haven’t felt quite right. The perfect place might be your home—and you might not even realize it yet.</p>
          </section>

    <section class="section" id="map">
      <h2>Where We're Looking</h2>
      <p>We’re especially interested in the neighborhoods around University School, Poet’s Corner, Laurel School, and Hathaway Brown School. If your home is nearby—or you know someone thinking about selling—we’d love to connect!</p>

    <section class="section" id="why-us">
      <h2>Why Sell to Us?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We're a small family with big love for this neighborhood</li>
        <li>We’re pre-approved and flexible on timing (you pick when!)</li>
        <li>We aren’t flippers or investors—we want to raise our daughter here</li>
        <li>We’ll treat your home with the care and pride it deserves</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you're even <em>thinking</em> about moving, let’s chat—no pressure, just people who love your house as much as you do.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="letter">
      <h2>Dear Future Neighbor,</h2>
      <p>We know it’s unusual to find a website like this—but that’s how much we love your neighborhood. We spend so much time here it already feels like home. We’re just missing the house.</p>
      <p>If you’re planning to move, downsizing, or just curious about your home’s value—we’d be honored to talk. We promise to be kind, respectful, and genuinely grateful for your time.</p>
      <p>Warmly,<br>Eric, Cara & Blake Spaulding</p>

    <section class="section" id="referral">
      <h2>Know a Neighbor Who’s Moving?</h2>
      <p>Sometimes the best homes never hit the market. If you know someone on your block who's even <em>thinking</em> of selling—send them our way. You might help two families at once.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="contact">
      <h2>Let’s Talk</h2>
      <p>If you're thinking about selling—or just want to feel flattered that someone really loves your house—text or call us:</p>
      <p><strong>📱 <a href="tel:2164351340">216-435-1340</a></strong></p>
      <p>You can also email us at <strong><a href="mailto:eric@spaulding.family">eric@spaulding.family</a></strong></p>
      <p>We’ll keep everything private and low-pressure. We’re just a family trying to find our forever spot in a place we love.</p>

    <p>Thanks for considering us. We promise to be the neighbors who shovel your walk when you’re out of town.</p>
