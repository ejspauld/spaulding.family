  <section class="intro">
    <p>Hi! Weâ€™re <strong>Eric, Cara, and our daughter Blake</strong>. Weâ€™re a normal (well... mostly normal) family who has completely fallen in love with the neighborhoods around Shaker Heights.</p>
    <p>Blake is already attending preschool nearby, we work in the area, and weâ€™re looking for a home where she can grow up walking to school, knowing her neighbors, and biking down quiet streets.</p>

  <section class="section" id="about">
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Eric works in cloud technology (yes, the internet kind), and Cara works in finance for a private equity firm in Cleveland. Weâ€™re professionals, devoted parents, and the kind of people who return your trash cans from the curb and bring cookies to new neighbors.</p>
    <p>Weâ€™ve been dreaming of living in this community for yearsâ€”and weâ€™re finally ready to put down roots. Weâ€™re serious buyers, fully pre-approved, and flexible on timing. If youâ€™ve even *thought* about selling, weâ€™d love to talkâ€”no pressure, just a conversation.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="why">
    <h2>Why This Area?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Blakeâ€™s school is nearby</li>
      <li>We love the architecture, walkability, and community feel</li>
      <li>We already spend most of our time hereâ€”now we want to live here too</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also, weâ€™ve already memorized every house on the MLS... and none of them are *quite* right. Yours might be.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="map">
    <h2>Where We're Looking</h2>
    <p>Weâ€™re especially interested in homes around Claythorne, Ashley, Parnell, and nearby streets. If your house is hereâ€”or you know a neighbor whoâ€™s ready for a changeâ€”weâ€™d love to hear from you!</p>

  <section class="section" id="contact">
    <h2>Letâ€™s Talk</h2>
    <p>If you're thinking about sellingâ€”or just want to feel flattered that someone really loves your houseâ€”text or call Eric:</p>
    <p><strong>ðŸ“± 555-123-4567</strong></p>
    <p>You can also email us at <strong>eric@spaulding.family</strong></p>
    <p>Weâ€™ll keep everything private and low-pressure. Weâ€™re just a family trying to find our forever spot in a place we love.</p>

  <footer>
    <p>Thanks for considering us. We promise to be the neighbors who shovel your walk when youâ€™re out of town.</p>
